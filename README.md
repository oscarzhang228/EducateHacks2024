## Inspiration 💡
Schools now almost exclusively use digital means in order to communicate with students about their assignments, exams, and grades. Because of that, students can get overwhelmed with the huge amount of notifications and emails they get. 

OrganizeMe leverages GenAI to help students keep on track of what they need to do and when they need to do it. Learning management systems often are hard to use and are overloaded with content. OrganizeMe takes in all of those assignments and displays them in an easy to read calendar format so that students can use it to plan their study schedules accordingly. 

Students use OrganizeMe to stay on top of their asignments and exams. OrganizeMe can help students do better on exams and assigments by giving them a structured approach to studying. 

## What it does 🤔
OrganizeMe is an innovative platform that integrates artificial intelligence to generate an optimal schedule based on user input and Learning Managment System (LMS) data in real-time. It takes in the importance of each assignment and correctly priorities it for students. For students, this means they can focus on actually doing the assignments instead of planning when to do assignments.

## How we built it ⚙️
First and foremost, we've build OrganizeMe with 💛. We have built a ML-enabled full-stack application that solves a real world problem. The whole process can be broken into the following points:

- Front-end development with React, styled using Bootstrap for a responsive and user-friendly interface.
  
- Back-end development with NodeJS and ExpressJS, utilizing MongoDB for database management.
  
- Implementation of OpenAI API for analyzing and creating a dynamic schedule. 
  
**The application's architecture ensures robustness, scalability, and a seamless user experience.**

## Design 🎨
Our inspiration drew heavily from the reimagined Double Diamond design process, emphasizing a comprehensive research cycle that mandates problem discovery and definition before delving into the solution phase and eventual deployment. This approach ensured a holistic and effective design strategy for the development of MarketSafe.

> 1. **Discover**: a deep dive into the problem we are trying to solve.
> 2. **Define**: synthesizing the information from the discovery phase into a problem definition.
> 3. **Develop**: think up solutions to the problem.
> 4. **Deliver**: pick the best solution and build that.

In addition, we leveraged design tools such as Figma to craft prototypes before diving into the coding process. This approach allowed us to gather iterative feedback early in the development cycle, reducing the need for extensive code revisions. By adopting this strategy, we streamlined our workflow and optimized the efficiency of the development process, ensuring that our final product, MarketSafe, met the highest standards in both functionality and user experience.

## Challenges we ran into   😤
Developing the OrganizeMe schedule generator using machine learning posed unique challenges for our all virtual team. Sticking to a strict budget which did not allow as much testing with OpenAI also forced us to be more careful with testing in our limited time. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 💚
Our team achieved significant milestones that fill us with pride, including successfully implementing machine learning with GPT-4 for advanced analysis, ensuring the seamless functionality of the backend, mastering collaborative teamwork, crafting an exceptional frontend user experience, and achieving an aesthetically pleasing and intuitive UI design. These accomplishments collectively reflect our dedication and proficiency in creating a robust and user-friendly platform with OrganizeMe.

## What we learned 🙌
Developing OrganizeMe allowed us to dive deep into learning the MERN stack as well as developing with the OpenAI API. With the majority of team members going from using templating engines to a front-end library such as React, we were able to significantly improve our skills in that department. 

## What's next?  🚀
As OrganizeMe continues to evolve, our vision encompasses a broader scope and deeper integration into the digital world. Here’s what we have planned for the future:

1. Partnership with LMS providers:
We aim to extend our services by directly offering this service in LMS for ease of use.

2. More Customization
We hope to provide users more ways to custimize exactly how their schedule is generated using the features of GenAI.

By realizing these goals, OrganizeMe aspires to become the go-to service for students and take the stress out of planning assignments and exams.
